Beta is a Decentralized Certification System

This system Basically handles certification processes, and is built on blockchain technology. There are two types of users, The Certificate Issuers, and the Certificate Claimers.

The Certificate Issuers are basically tutors/teachers, who pass value to their students for a fee, and needs to issue them their certification on the blockchain, which is made posible by the use of Non-Fungible Tokens(NFTs). The tutors Issue out there Certifications as NFTs listing, and the students, picks the certification for which ever course they've completed, goes through a test, by which if passed, they would receive their NFT Certificate.
